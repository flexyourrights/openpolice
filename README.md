OpenPolice is an open-source, open data web app empowering citizens to prepare, file, and track reports of police conduct. The site helps users submit complaints or commendations to appropriate police oversight agencies. By allowing users to publish reports online, we aim to establish better public transparency and oversight of police activity in the U.S. OpenPolice extends <a href="https://github.com/rockhopsoft/survloop" target="_blank">Survloop</a>, which runs atop <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a>.

<a href="https://openpolice.org" target="_blank">OpenPolice.org</a>
This software began as an internal tool to design our database, then prototype survey generation. Then it was adapted to the Laravel framework, and has continued to grow towards a content-management system for data-focused websites.

The upcoming OpenPolice web app can be tested out here, feedback welcome via the end of the <b>beta demo</b> submission process: <a href="https://openpolice.org/file-your-police-complaint" target="_blank">/file-your-police-complaint</a>
The resulting database designed using the engine, as well as the branching tree which specifies the user's experience: <a href="https://openpolice.org/db/OP" target="_blank">/db/OP</a>, <a href="https://openpolice.org/tree/complaint" target="_blank">/tree/complaint</a>
Among other methods, the resulting data can also be provided as XML included an automatically generated schema: <a href="https://openpolice.org/complaint-xml-schema" target="_blank">/complaint-xml-schema</a>, <a href="https://openpolice.org/complaint-xml-example" target="_blank">/complaint-xml-example</a>, <a href="https://openpolice.org/complaint-xml-all" target="_blank">/complaint-xml-all</a>

# <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

## Installing OpenPolice

<a href="https://openpolice.org/how-to-install-local-openpolice" target="_blank">Full install instructions</a> also describe how to set up a development environment using VirutalBox, Vargrant, and <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead" target="_blank">Laravel's Homestead</a>. For these instructions, the new project directory is 'myopenpolice'.

### Install Laravel, Survloop, & OpenPolice on Homestead
```
% composer create-project laravel/laravel myopenpolice "8.5.*"
% cd myopenpolice

```

Edit these lines of the environment file to connect the default MYSQL database:
```
% nano .env
```
```
APP_NAME="My Open Police"
APP_URL=http://myopenpolice.local

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=33060
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_DATABASE=myopenpolice
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

Next, install Laravel's out-of-the-box user authentication tools, Survloop, and the OpenPolice.org software:
```
% php artisan key:generate
% php artisan cache:clear
% COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer require mpdf/mpdf rockhopsoft/survloop flexyourrights/openpolice
% nano composer.json
```

From your Laravel installation's root directory, update `composer.json` to require and easily reference OpenPolice:
```
$ nano composer.json
```
```
...
"autoload": {
    ...
    "psr-4": {
        ...
        "FlexYourRights\\OpenPolice\\": "vendor/flexyourrights/openpolice/src/",
        "RockHopSoft\\Survloop\\": "vendor/rockhopsoft/survloop/src/",
        "Predis\\": "vendor/predis/predis/src/",
    }
    ...
}, ...
```

Hopefully, editing `config/app.php` is no longer needed, but this can be tried if later steps break.
```
$ nano config/app.php
```
```
...
'providers' => [
    ...
    App\Providers\FortifyServiceProvider::class,
    FlexYourRights\OpenPolice\OpenPoliceServiceProvider::class,
    RockHopSoft\Survloop\SurvloopServiceProvider::class,
    ...
],
...
'aliases' => [
    ...
    'OpenPolice' => 'FlexYourRights\OpenPolice\OpenPoliceFacade',
    'Survloop' => 'RockHopSoft\Survloop\SurvloopFacade',
    ...
], ...
```

If installing on a server, you might also need to fix some permissions before the following steps...
```
% chown -R www-data:33 storage database app/Models
```

Clear caches and publish the package migrations...
```
% php artisan config:clear
% php artisan route:clear
% php artisan view:clear
% echo "0" | php artisan vendor:publish --force
% composer dump-autoload
% curl http://myopenpolice.local/css-reload
```

With certain databases (like some managed by DigitalOcean), you may need to tweak the Laravel migration:
```
$ nano database/migrations/2014_10_12_100000_create_password_resets_table.php
$ sudo nano database/migrations/2019_08_19_000000_create_failed_jobs_table.php
```
Add this line before the "Schema::create" line in each file:
```
\Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB::statement('SET SESSION sql_require_primary_key=0');
```

Then initialize the database:
```
$ php artisan migrate
$ php artisan db:seed --class=OpenPoliceSeeder
$ php artisan db:seed --class=OpenPoliceDeptSeeder
$ php artisan db:seed --class=ZipCodeSeeder
$ php artisan db:seed --class=ZipCodeSeeder2
$ php artisan db:seed --class=ZipCodeSeeder3
$ php artisan db:seed --class=ZipCodeSeeder4
```

### Initialize OpenPolice Installation

Then browsing to the home page should prompt you to create the first admin user account:<br />
http://myopenpolice.local

If everything looks janky, then manually load the style sheets, etc:<br />
http://myopenpolice.local/css-reload

After logging in as an admin, this link rebuilds many supporting files:<br />
http://myopenpolice.local/dashboard/settings?refresh=2


# <a name="documentation"></a>Documentation

Once installed, documentation of this system's database design can be found at /dashboard/db/all . This system's user experience design for data entry can be found at /dashboard/tree/map?all=1&alt=1 or publicly visible links like those above.

Better documentation is juuust beginning to be created...<br />

More on the Survloop level is also starting here: <br />

# <a name="roadmap"></a>Roadmap

Here's the TODO list for the next release (**1.0**). It's my first time building on Laravel, or GitHub. So sorry.

* [ ] Correct all issues needed for minimum viable product, and launch Open Police Complaints.
* [ ] Integrate options for MFA using Laravel-compatible package.
* [ ] Code commenting, learning and adopting more community norms.
* [ ] Add decent levels of unit testing. Hopefully improve the organization of objects/classes.
